# Overview

As a software engineer, I developed a program to manage student records using Python and a SQL Relational Database. The program integrates with the database to store, retrieve, update, and delete student data.

The purpose of this software is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing student records. Users can add new students, update their grades, generate reports, and perform other CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

# Relational Database

I am using a SQLite Relational Database for this software. The database consists of one table called "students" with the following structure:

id (INTEGER): Primary key for identifying each student.
name (TEXT): Name of the student.
grade (REAL): Grade of the student.

# Development Environment

o develop this software, I used the following tools:

Python: A high-level programming language.
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based relational database management system.
SQLite3 module: A Python library for interacting with SQLite databases.

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to:

1. Implement user authentication and access control to ensure data security.
2. Enhance the reporting functionality to generate more detailed and customizable reports.
3. Implement data validation and error handling to improve the robustness of the program.
