# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal was to further my learning in R and demonstrate my proficiency in the language. To accomplish this, I developed a software project that focuses on cleaning and preprocessing messy data, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis

The software I wrote is a data preprocessing tool in R. It provides functions for cleaning and preprocessing messy data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis. It incorporates various techniques such as replacing missing values with mean, scaling numerical variables, and converting character vectors to factors. The software works with data frames and utilizes different R data types to process and manipulate the data.

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
R Extension: R extension provided by Yuki Ueda for VSCode
RStudio: Used for debugging and exploring data
R version: 4.1.1

# Useful Websites

- [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/)
- [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

# Future Work

- Improve the user interface and make the software more user-friendly with interactive features.
- Expand the functionality to handle more complex data preprocessing tasks.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
