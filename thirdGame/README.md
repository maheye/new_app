# Overview

For my software engineering learning journey, I created a to-do list application in C++. This program allows users to manage tasks by adding, marking as completed, and deleting them. The project's primary goal was to reinforce my understanding of C++ syntax, particularly data structures and user input handling.

# Future Work

- Item 1 Enhanced User Interface: Improve the user interface for a more interactive and visually appealing experience.
- Item 2 Task Categories: Add functionality to categorize tasks, enabling users to group tasks based on different criteria.
- Item 3 Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to deal with unexpected user inputs and edge cases.
